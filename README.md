## Description

The purpose of this project was to use the Node.js framework along with the npm package inquirer to generate a profession README markdown file for the user. It uses the inquirer prompt functionality to take input from the user and use that input in various ways in the README file.

## Installation

The instructions are rather simple. Once you have all the files from the repository just ensure you have node install, then run the command to install inquirer (npm i inquirer).
  
## Usage

All that is needed is to run the command “node index.js” and the inquirer prompts will appear.

## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome.
  
## Tests

Testing is as simple as running the program and typing short answers as responses and ensuring all of the answers appear correctly in the README.md file generated. It is worth noting that the answers to the GitHub and email questions are used to create links, so in testing you will want to answer with a valid GitHub username and valid email respectively.
